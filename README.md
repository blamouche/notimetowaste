# Efficient Meeting Pattern - EMP  v1.0.1

[Subscribe to updates](https://subscribepage.io/efficientmeeting)

## Why?

> 90 percent of employees feel meetings are "costly" and "unproductive" 

"Status" meetings are a *waste of time* and *extremely costly* for the company.

    A 1-hour meeting with 4 people = 4 hours spent
    An all-hands meeting of 2 hours with 40 people = 80 hours = 10 days spent

**The Efficient Meeting Pattern aims to reduce by four times the time spent on "status" meetings**

## How does it work?

EMP is like an application that offers several levels of features. It can also be compared to a physical or sporting activity where there are different levels based on each person's skill.

## Modules

The principle revolves around a central module that is enriched with satellite modules depending on our level of expectation and maturity.


## How to start?

Efficient Meeting Pattern follows a logic of transformation. It is therefore recommended to gradually start applying the principles and increase the [level](#3-levels) as the team becomes more engaged.

Below are the details of the [3 EMP levels](#3-levels).


## 3 levels

## The pattern

### Sequence

1. **Prepare** your meeting
2. **Send** the invitation including all details following the [template](#meeting-template)
3. **Share** status on the shared document **asynchronously**
4. **Conduct** the meeting

### Meeting agenda & timing
- 5 minutes for Introduction
- 10 minutes for Q&A and potential alerts
- *(Optional)* 30 minutes for collaboration

### Templates

#### Sharing document template

This document is used to share all updates prior to the meeting so that participants can focus on the essentials during the discussion.

In case there is no immediate need to collaborate on a specific topic, you can skip the last 30 minutes of the meeting.


## How to communicate and get adhesion from your team?

Explain the "Why," the starting point, the foundation. The idea is not to add something or propose a "new reorganization." The core of the subject is the meaning of our work and the waste of our resources.

Lead by example. Probably the best way to prove the model's viability.

Communication. Include the image of your badge in your invitations; this should spark curiosity and perhaps even debates.
We have two sets of badges to choose from according to your preferences (copy/paste):

[![Level 1](icons/level-minimalist-s.png)](https://efficientmeeting.lamouche.fr/) 
[![Level 2](icons/level-perfectionist-s.png)](https://efficientmeeting.lamouche.fr/) 
[![Level 3](icons/level-nerd-s.png)](https://efficientmeeting.lamouche.fr/) 


[![Level 1](icons/level-1-s.png)](https://efficientmeeting.lamouche.fr/) 
[![Level 2](icons/level-2-s.png)](https://efficientmeeting.lamouche.fr/) 
[![Level 3](icons/level-3-s.png)](https://efficientmeeting.lamouche.fr/)
